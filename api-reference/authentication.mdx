## Overview

All API requests require authentication using three headers. You'll need to register your application first to get your App ID, and obtain API keys from your center's settings.

## Required Headers

<ParamField path="X-API-APP-ID" type="string" required>
	The ID you received when you registered your application. See the [Create
	App](/api-reference/endpoint/create-app) endpoint for registration details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="X-API-SECRET-KEY" type="string" required>
	The API secret key provided by your center.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="X-API-PUBLIC-KEY" type="string" required>
	The API public key provided by your center.
</ParamField>

## Optional Headers

<ParamField path="X-LOCALE" type="string">
	Specify the language/locale for localized responses. When provided, the API
	will return humanized data in the requested language (e.g., status names,
	role descriptions, formatted dates). **Available locales:** - `ro` - Română
	🇷🇴 - `en` - English 🇺🇸 - `no` - Norge 🇳🇴 - `fr` - French 🇫🇷 - `de` -
	Deutschland 🇩🇪 - `ru` - Россия (Rossiya) 🇷🇺 - `bg` - България (Bulgariya) 🇧🇬
	- `uk` - Україна (Ukrayina) 🇺🇦 - `it` - Italia 🇮🇹 - `es` - España 🇪🇸 If not
	provided, the API will use your center's default language.
</ParamField>

## Getting Your API Keys

The keys provided by the center can be found in your center's admin panel:

1. Navigate to **General Settings** → **Other Settings**
2. On the top right, click the button leading to the **API Secret Keys** page
3. You'll find the **API Public Key** on the top right
4. Next to it, there's a button to create a new secret key for each app that wishes to connect to your center's account through the API

<Note>
	Each application should have its own secret key for security purposes.
</Note>

## Example Request Headers

```bash
X-API-APP-ID: your-app-id-here
X-API-SECRET-KEY: your-secret-key-here
X-API-PUBLIC-KEY: your-public-key-here
X-LOCALE: en
```

<Note>
	The `X-LOCALE` header is optional. When included, responses will be
	localized to the specified language.
