## Overview

All API requests require authentication using three headers. You'll need to register your application first to get your App ID, and obtain API keys from your center's settings.

## Required Headers

<ParamField path="X-API-APP-ID" type="string" required>
	The ID you received when you registered your application. See the [Create
	App](/api-reference/endpoint/create-app) endpoint for registration details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="X-API-SECRET-KEY" type="string" required>
	The API secret key provided by your center.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="X-API-PUBLIC-KEY" type="string" required>
	The API public key provided by your center.
</ParamField>

## Getting Your API Keys

The keys provided by the center can be found in your center's admin panel:

1. Navigate to **General Settings** â†’ **Other Settings**
2. On the top right, click the button leading to the **API Secret Keys** page
3. You'll find the **API Public Key** on the top right
4. Next to it, there's a button to create a new secret key for each app that wishes to connect to your center's account through the API

<Note>
	Each application should have its own secret key for security purposes.
</Note>

## Example Request Headers

```bash
X-API-APP-ID: your-app-id-here
X-API-SECRET-KEY: your-secret-key-here
X-API-PUBLIC-KEY: your-public-key-here
```
