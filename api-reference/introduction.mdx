## Welcome

Welcome to the Teamm API documentation. This API allows you to integrate with Teamm's booking and guest management system.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. Please see the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page for detailed information about required headers and how to obtain your API keys.

## API Reference

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.
