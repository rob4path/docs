## Welcome

Welcome to the Teamm API documentation. This API allows you to integrate with Teamm's booking and guest management system for wellness centers, spas, and health facilities.

## What You Can Do

The Teamm API enables you to:

-   **Manage Guests**: Retrieve guest information, bookings, and status updates

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. Please see the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page for detailed information about required headers and how to obtain your API keys.

## Data Format

The Teamm API returns data in **humanized format**, meaning all information is localized and ready for display in your application. Use the `X-LOCALE` header to specify your preferred language.

## Rate Limits

The API has the following rate limits:
