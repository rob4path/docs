# Guest Meal Skipping - User Guide

A specialized tool to track which meals guests will **skip** during their stay. This helps kitchen staff plan portions accurately by knowing exactly how many guests will **not** be eating each meal.

<Note>
	**Important**: This feature is for tracking meal **skipping only** - not
	general meal attendance. It assumes all guests eat all meals by default, and
	you only mark the exceptions (meals they won't attend).
</Note>

## Who Can Use This Feature

You need the **"Guest Meal Skipping"** permission to access this feature. If you don't see the meal preferences button, contact your administrator to get access.

**Typically used by:**

-   Kitchen staff for meal planning
-   Guest services for handling requests
-   Reception staff during check-in
-   Supervisors for oversight

## How to Open Meal Preferences

1. Go to the **Guests** section
2. Find and click on a guest's name
3. Look for the **üçΩÔ∏è fork and knife icon** button
4. Click it to open the meal preferences sidebar

## Understanding the Interface

### What You'll See

The interface shows a schedule grid where:

-   **Each row** = One day of the guest's stay
-   **Each column** = A meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
-   **Gray "DEFAULT" buttons** = Guest will eat this meal if provided by center (normal)
-   **Red "SKIPPING" buttons** = Guest will skip this meal (exception)

### Key Principle

**This tool tracks SKIPPING only, not attendance.**

-   All guests are assumed to eat all meals by default
-   You only mark meals they will **NOT** attend
-   This is not for tracking who showed up - it's for planning how many portions to prepare
-   Kitchen staff use this to reduce portion counts, not increase them

## Daily Tasks

### For Kitchen Staff

#### Morning Routine - Count Skipping Guests

1. Open the meal preferences for guests staying today
2. Look at the **red "SKIPPING" buttons** for today's date
3. Count how many guests are **skipping** each meal:
    - Breakfast skipping count
    - Lunch skipping count
    - Dinner skipping count
4. **Reduce your portions accordingly** - prepare fewer meals, not more

<Warning>
	**Kitchen Planning**: If 25 guests are staying and 5 are skipping breakfast,
	prepare breakfast for 20 guests (25 - 5 = 20).
</Warning>

### For Guest Services

#### During Check-in

1. Ask the guest: _"Will you be eating all meals with us, or would you like to skip any?"_
2. Open their meal preferences
3. Click to mark any meals they want to skip as **red "SKIPPING"**
4. The schedule shows their entire stay - mark all the meals they won't attend

#### Handling Special Requests

## Reading the Statistics

At the bottom, you'll see summary counts:

-   **Breakfast: 3 Skipping** = Guest will skip 3 breakfasts during their stay

-   **Dinner: 1 Skipping** = Guest will skip 1 dinner

Kitchen staff use these numbers for weekly planning.

## API Access for Developers
