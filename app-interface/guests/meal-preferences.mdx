# Guest Meal Preferences - User Guide

A simple tool to track which meals guests will skip during their stay. This helps kitchen staff plan portions accurately and ensures guests get the service they need.

## Who Can Use This Feature

You need the **"Guest Meal Skipping"** permission to access this feature. If you don't see the meal preferences button, contact your administrator to get access.

**Typically used by:**

-   Kitchen staff for meal planning
-   Guest services for handling requests
-   Reception staff during check-in
-   Supervisors for oversight

## How to Open Meal Preferences

1. Go to the **Guests** section
2. Find and click on a guest's name
3. Look for the **üçΩÔ∏è fork and knife icon** button
4. Click it to open the meal preferences sidebar

## Understanding the Interface

### What You'll See

The interface shows a schedule grid where:

-   **Each row** = One day of the guest's stay
-   **Each column** = A meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
-   **Gray "DEFAULT" buttons** = Guest will eat this meal if provided by center (normal)
-   **Red "SKIPPING" buttons** = Guest will skip this meal (exception)

### Key Principle

**Guests eat all meals by default.** You only mark the meals they want to skip.

## Daily Tasks

### For Kitchen Staff

#### When Guests Make Changes

1. Find the guest in the system
2. Open their meal preferences
3. Click the meal button to change from DEFAULT to SKIPPING
4. The change saves automatically

### For Guest Services

#### During Check-in

1. Ask the guest: _"Will you be eating all meals with us, or would you like to skip any?"_
2. Open their meal preferences
3. Click to mark any meals they want to skip as **red "SKIPPING"**
4. The schedule shows their entire stay - mark all the meals they won't attend

#### Handling Special Requests

-   Guest wants to skip all breakfasts: Use **"All Skipping Breakfasts"** button
-   Guest wants to skip one specific day: Use the **day action buttons** (üö´ or ‚úÖ)
-   Guest changes their mind: Click the meal button to toggle back to DEFAULT

### For Reception Staff

#### Guest Registration

1. During registration, ask about meal preferences
2. Open the guest's meal preferences
3. Mark any meals they plan to skip
4. This helps kitchen staff from day one

## Reading the Statistics

At the bottom, you'll see summary counts:

-   **Breakfast: 3 Skipping** = Guest will skip 3 breakfasts during their stay
-   **Lunch: 0 Skipping** = Guest attends all lunches
-   **Dinner: 1 Skipping** = Guest will skip 1 dinner

Kitchen staff use these numbers for weekly planning.

## API Access for Developers

You can programmatically access guest meal skipping information using the [GET /guests API endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get-guests) by including `skippingMeals` in your project parameters.
